  * Establishes the connection to the server, and initializes the
  * \p libtelnet structure, including registering the event handler callback.
  *
  * Errors encountered during telnet event handling are indicated by an internal flag,
  * which must be checked each time a libtelnet function is called.  If it is nonzero an
  * error has occurred.
  *
  * Responses from the server are accumulated in the \p m_strRead member.  It is typically
  * cleared before reading, but this can be suppressed when desired.
  *
  * Because of the way event handling is managed, and the class-global error and response accumulation
  * this is not thread-safe.  Any calls to this class methods should be mutex-ed.
